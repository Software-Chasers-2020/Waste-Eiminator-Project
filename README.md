Problem Statement:
W-07 Website/App for collection, transportation, disposal and 
segregation of waste product


Abstract
The tremendous increase in the population of the country has led to improper waste management in cities which results in increased pests and spread harmful diseases across the regions. Though proper measures are being taken to avoid wastage at the production level in industries, the waste generated from using such goods is not disposed of properly. People are unaware of the issues caused by their careless waste disposals. So keeping all this in mind, our project proposes a smart waste elimination web portal that will help people to segregate waste properly for better disposal and also tracks the vehicles carrying waste and also locate the dustbins nearby your accommodation. These will help the respective authorities to take necessary actions to reduce waste generation.
In this web portal, interested people can apply as volunteers with the help of provided Google form link because we believe “It’s not just collection of waste, it’s a waste management”, who can help for handling the situation of waste management in their locality. Through email a letter of appreciation will be provided to the volunteers and certificates for the people participating in the events will be provided to encourage more participation. We also added blogs, slogans in different languages to spread awareness. There are some pages created with attractive interface to gain people’s attention towards waste elimination and make the world a better place to live in.


This is a project that is completely designed from scratch without using any template.

The modules in the proposed web portal as follows

1.	Elegant, interactive user interface –

With the use of html, css, bootstrap and javascript we have created attractive user interface by adding animation part to it .We have also created blogs , slogans in different language for spreading awareness among people about waste management. By clicking on the buttons saying swatcha bharat, clean India, Nirmal bharat we can get pages in the respective language. The entise website can be easily hadled and understood by anyone. 

2.	Database  -
To store/view/retrieve the details of IDs allocated to dustbins. We have used MySql database.
With the help of database it is checked that which dustbin is allocate to which particular area. The database will store the data regarding when and where the dustbin are added, who has added that dustbin, etc. The last cleaning date of the dustbins Of garbage bins is also mentioned in the database which will help the citizens to communicate with the government reagarding cleaning and maintaining hygiene. The record of different categories of waste like medical,organic., etc is also maintained in our database. The record of dustbins alloted that day,the day before andin that particular  week is also displayed just by pressing one button present in our admin panel. One can also print the record of a particular dustbin from our portal. The feature of updating the details of a particular dustbin is also provided for the convinience of the user. 
 
3  . Tracking –
Maintenance of a completely robust and efficient database to track all the information on waste generation and disposal by keeping track of the vehicles carrying waste through your mobile phones by just a click is made easy through this portal. 
Also volunteer’s will help the admin keep a track of the vehicles carrying garbage. The users will have to fill a google form. They will receive a link of the location of the garbage truck driver through mail merge. So it is one of the most efficient, portable and cost efficient way to do tracking. 

4.	Search- We have included a search tab that will display the information of the dustbin about the last cleaned information when users enter the ID number of the particular dustbin located on it. It will also display all other details regarding that dusbin to make it easy for the user to get all the information in just one click. 
     
5.  Online Portal to report problems and give suggestions on waste management.
	If waste is not collected from dustbin on proper time the volunteers in that particular area can report that problem though mail. Also problems and improvements can be mentioned or suggested on our social media accounts for issues that are not being solved by our volunteers.

6.	Events Organized –
	Our commitment to diversity is evident through our conscious efforts to make sure everyone feels seen and heard about it. A welcoming culture, unlimited possibilities and a future-minded, sustainable mission to  see what makes Waste elimination  a great place to work,  events should organized.  We will be organizing events, quizzes and games with the help of our volunteer’s. People participating in the events will receive certificates through their mail. 
7.	Blogs & Slogans –
Blogs with attractive UI to spread awareness among people about waste management. Also blogs in different languages will make people understand better the importance of waste management.

8.	Social Media handle-
As the youth is the heart of our nation and as most of the people today use social media, we have also created our pages on various social media platforms to increase communication with the people and grab their attention.


We have also created a web app for providing easy , quick and handy access to the people.


Future Scope –
1. Using GPS one can keep track on locating the dustbins in different area.
2. For vehicles carrying waste will be able to find shortest way to reach the allocated areas that will be time consuming.
3. Also Raspberry Pi or arduino can be used for efficient tracking.
4. We can also include a chatbot in our website for 24x7 to ensure easy communication with the users.
