# Waste-Eiminator-Project
Waste management has become a matter of concern with increasing waste products due to increase in population. Keeping this in mind, we decided to work on a project which is simple yet versatile web portal for easy collection, transportation and segregation of waste products. The portal is be quite user friendly. The people can track the vehicles carrying waste and also locate the dustbins near their accommodation. It will help people to segregate waste properly for better disposal. The portal has a section where interested people can apply as volunteers and can help handle the situation of waste management in their locality, letter of appreciation through mail will be provided to the volunteers to encourage more participation. We added  blogs, posters and slogans in different languages to create awareness among the people regarding waste management. One will also be able to access the entire web portal through their devices on any browser. Waste Eliminator team want to attract people to make a best practices for eliminating waste in all possible ways.  Website link:-  http://wasteeliminator.c1.biz/
